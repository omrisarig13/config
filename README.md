# Configuration dot files
This repository includes all the config files that I am using on my local
machine.

## Machine type
I am running Manjaro linux 64 bit, for any compatibility issues.

## Notes
* Some of my mapping might seem odd to you. This is probably since I use Dvorak
  is my keyboard layout, so my home row is very different from the default
  qwerty one.

# Copyrights
I produced only part of my config by myself. Most of it was copied from places
along the web, or copied and modified slightly.

If you found out that I am using a code that is yours and you want me to mention
your original code, or you want me to stop using it, you are more than welcome
to contact me.
